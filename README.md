# ActivityJournalApp
My first API project and my first go at React JS created as a lab in the course Application development for the internet at ume√• university. It uses .NET core, SQL, and Entity Framework in the [backend](https://github.com/aurorasuper/ActivityAppBackend) and React JS with Tailwind CSS in the frontend.

It is a habit tracking app where users can create logs of activities that they do. Due to time constraints, the app is not live.
